## Detailed Command Descriptions

### System Commands

- **🔨 rebuild**: Performs a system rebuild for the current host. It automatically detects your hostname and rebuilds the appropriate configuration. Includes backup file cleanup before rebuilding.

- **🥾 rebuild-boot**: Similar to rebuild, but sets the new configuration as the boot default without immediately switching to it. Changes will take effect on next restart.

- **🔄 update**: Updates your flake inputs to the latest versions, then rebuilds the system. This ensures you get the latest packages and security updates.

- **🔀 switch-host**: Launches the interactive host switcher script, allowing you to easily switch between different host configurations.

### Multi-Host Commands

- **🔨 build [HOST]**: Builds a configuration for the specified host without activating it. Useful for testing configurations or preparing for deployment. Example: `dcli build homework`

- **🚀 deploy [HOST]**: Builds and immediately switches to the specified host configuration. Use with caution as it will change your current system configuration. Example: `dcli deploy homework`

- **📋 list-hosts**: Shows all available host configurations in your setup. Marks the current host configuration for easy identification.

### Maintenance Commands

- **🧹 cleanup**: Manages system storage by removing old generations. You can choose to remove all old generations or specify a number to keep. This helps free up disk space and clean up the boot menu.

- **🛠️ diag**: Creates a comprehensive diagnostic report including system information, git status, and host configurations. The report is saved to `~/diag.txt` and is useful for troubleshooting or sharing system details.

- **📋 list-gens**: Displays current user and system generations, helping you understand what's installed and plan cleanup operations.

- **✂️ trim**: Optimizes filesystems, particularly beneficial for SSDs. Improves performance and reduces wear by trimming unused blocks.

### Git Commands

- **📝 commit [message]**: Adds all changes in your mavnezz-os directory and commits them with the specified message. If no message is provided, you'll be prompted to enter one.

- **⬆️ push**: Pushes your committed changes to your GitLab fork. Automatically detects the current branch.

- **⬇️ pull**: Pulls the latest changes from your GitLab fork to keep your local copy up to date.

- **📊 status**: Shows the current git status of your mavnezz-os directory, including modified files and branch information.

## Multi-Host Workflow Examples

### Preparing a New Host Configuration
```bash
# List available hosts
dcli list-hosts

# Build configuration for new host (test without deploying)
dcli build homework

# If build successful, deploy to the target system
dcli deploy homework
```

### Managing Multiple Computers
```bash
# On your laptop (surface)
fr                    # Quick rebuild current host

# Switch to desktop configuration (if managing remotely)
dcli deploy homework

# Interactive switching
switch                # or dcli switch-host
```

### Maintenance Routine
```bash
# Update system
fu                    # Fast update (dcli update)

# Clean up old generations
cleanup               # dcli cleanup

# Trim SSD
dcli trim

# Check system status
dcli diag
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Make changes to configuration files
# ...

# Check what changed
dcli status

# Commit changes
dcli commit "Updated desktop configuration"

# Test build
dcli build homework

# Push to repository
dcli push

# Deploy to target system
dcli deploy homework
```

## Configuration

dcli automatically detects:
- **Current Host**: From the system hostname
- **Project Directory**: `~/mavnezz-os`
- **Available Hosts**: From the `devices/` directory
- **Current Profile**: From your flake configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
```bash
# Generate diagnostic report
dcli diag

# Check git status
dcli status

# List available hosts
dcli list-hosts

# Try building specific host
dcli build [hostname]
```

### Host Not Found
If you get "Host not found" errors:
1. Check available hosts: `dcli list-hosts`
2. Ensure you're in the correct directory
3. Verify the host directory exists under `devices/`

### Permission Issues
Some commands require sudo privileges:
- `dcli rebuild`
- `dcli deploy [HOST]` 
- `dcli trim`

### Git Issues
If git commands fail:
1. Check you're in the correct directory: `dcli status`
2. Ensure you have proper Git credentials configured
3. Verify your remote is set up correctly
