<summary><strong>**ZaneyOS v2.0** </strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

With this new update of ZaneyOS it is a big rewrite of how things are being
done. This update fixes many issues that you guys were facing. As well as makes
things a little easier to understand. You now have a lot being stored inside the
specific host directory, making use of modules, condensing seperate files down,
etc. My hope is that with this update your ability to grasp the flake and expand
it to what you need is much improved. I want to thank everyone for being so
supportive!

- Most configuration put into specific hosts directories for the best
  portability.
- Using modules to condense configuration complexity.
- Simplified options and the complexity around understanding their
  implementation.
- Rewrote the documentation for improved readability.
